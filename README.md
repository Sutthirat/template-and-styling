# MAQE Homework Challenge - Template and Styling

Time: about 60 minutes recommended.

Recreate the following reference image in HTML and CSS using a templating library.

### Requirements

You can use any markup, styles and layout method necessary, but you must use these JSON files as your data source:  [authors](http://maqe.github.io/json/authors.json)  and  [posts](http://maqe.github.io/json/posts.json).

You must use a template library. Either a standalone library or one that is a part of a framework.

Also, links do not have to function at all. The pagination and any other links are for display only.

### Programming Language

If you are applying as a  [Back End Engineer](https://www.maqe.com/jobs/back-end-engineer/)  definitely use a back end language. (MAQE uses PHP primarily, but feel free to use whichever language you're most comfortable with.) Frameworks are OK too.

If you are applying as a  [Front End Engineer](https://www.maqe.com/jobs/front-end-engineer/)  please use Javascript and a JS templating library (like Handlebars.js, etc.) Frameworks are OK too.

If you are applying as a a Fullstack Engineer feel free to do one or both of the above.
